# OpenPME
OpenPME is a domain-specific language (DSL) and development environment for implementing scientific
simulations based on particle and mesh methods. It generates C++ code that links with the OpenFPM
library (http://openfpm.mpi-cbg.de). OpenPME provides a high-level way of implementing discrete as well as continuous simulations.

# Environment
OpenPME runs on MPS 2019.2.4
